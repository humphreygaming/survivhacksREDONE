# Welcome to Surviv.io-Cheats (Currently being fixed)
This is a Surviv.io cheat loaded as a Chrome extension. It was originally developed by w3x731 and later maintained by Zbot (on an indifinite vacation) and I've decided to continue the development of the code.

### Future of this hack 
Zbot is gone and it will be very unlikely that I will maintain this project forever. Sorry :(

### Current Features

* Aimbot
* Aimbot with collision detection [beta]
* Bump Fire (hold click button)
* Custom zooming control with scroll wheel
* Autoloot
* Lasersight (shot range)
* Displays enemy lines
* Frag grenade timer
* Auto opening doors (laggy, somewhat useless, [beta])
* Fast weapon changing (right click)
* Auto heal
* FPS and LAT (full grid visisbility)
* Planes tracking + visibility of air drop on minimap has been extended (not working)
* AutoDodge [beta] [broken]
* AutoSwitch
* Triggerbot
* Color explosive barrels in red
* Bigger and more vibrant bullets
* New Default Cursor
